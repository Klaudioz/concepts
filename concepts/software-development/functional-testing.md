# Functional Testing (End to End)

Functional testing is defined as the testing of complete functionality of some application. In practice with web apps, this means using some tool to automate a browser ([[automation]]), which is then used to click around on the pages to test the application.

This is usually done as part of the [[continuous-integration]] step in your deployment pipeline.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[automation]: ../organization-operations/automation "Automation"
[continuous-integration]: continuous-integration "Continuous Integration (CI)"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
