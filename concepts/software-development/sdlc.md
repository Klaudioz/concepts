# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

[Software Development Life Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle) (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

SDLC can be described along a spectrum of agile to iterative to sequential methodologies. [[agile]] methodologies, such as XP and [[scrum]], focus on lightweight processes which allow for rapid changes (without necessarily following the pattern of SDLC approach) along the development cycle.
