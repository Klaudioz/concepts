# Cycle Time

Software development cycle time measures the amount of time from work started to work delivered. It is a metric borrowed from lean manufacturing, and it is one of the most important metrics for software development teams. In plain speak, cycle time measures the amount of time from first commit to production release.

Affected by [[continuous-integration]], [[continuous-deployment]] and [[continuous-delivery]] practices.
