# Quality Assurance (Software)

[Software quality assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_assurance) (SQA) is a means of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used in a project to ensure proper quality. This is accomplished by many and varied approaches. It may include ensuring conformance to standards or models, such as ISO 9000 or CMMI.

SQA encompasses the entire software development process, including requirements definition, software design, coding, code reviews, source code control, software configuration management, testing, release management and product integration. It is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements and verification.
