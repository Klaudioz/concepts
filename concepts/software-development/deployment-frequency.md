# Deployment Frequency

Deployment frequency otherwise known as throughput, is a measure of how frequently your team deploys code. This metric is often represented as a percentage and it answers the question “how often do we deploy to production or to another significant point in our [[continuous-delivery]] pipeline such as a [[staging-environment]]?”
