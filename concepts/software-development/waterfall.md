## Waterfall Model

The waterfall model is a sequential design process in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/Implementation, and Maintenance.

Due to the need to adapt and innovate, most companies adopt a more [[agile]] approach to their [[sdlc]]Maintenance.
