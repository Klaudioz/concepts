# California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

The [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act) (CCPA), adopted on 28 June 2018, establishes one of the most comprehensive data privacy regulations in the US. As such, it could be considered the US counterpart of the [[gdpr]]. The CCPA, however, only regulates companies “doing business” in the State of California.
