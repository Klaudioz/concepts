# Streaming Processing

Stream processing is the processing of data in motion, or in other words, computing on data directly as it is produced or received. The majority of data are born as continuous streams: sensor events, user activity on a website, financial trades, and so on â€“ all these data are created as a series of events over time.

The alternative is [[batch-processing]] where set of data is collected over time and processed in batches.
