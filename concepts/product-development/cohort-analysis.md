# Cohort Analysis

Cohort analysis is a subset of behavioral [[data-analytics]] that takes the data from a given data set and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.
