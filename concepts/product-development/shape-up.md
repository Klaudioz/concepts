# Shape Up

[Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) is a product development framework developed and released online for free by [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com). It covers the process from “shaping” raw ideas into low-risk, time-boxed projects to finally implementing the solution in small teams within 6-week cycles. It also discusses how to fight scope creep and monitor progress during a cycle.
