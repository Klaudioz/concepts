# Wardley Map

A [Wardley Map](https://medium.com/wardleymaps) is a representation of the landscape in which a business operates. It consists of a [[value-chain]] (activities needed to fulfill user needs) graphed against evolution (how individual activities change over time under supply and demand competition). A Wardley Map represents the situational awareness and shared assumptions being made about a context and hints at what strategic options are available.
