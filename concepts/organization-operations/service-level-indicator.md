# Service Level Indicator

An SLI (service level indicator) measures compliance with an SLO ([[service-level-objective]]). So, for example, if your [[service-level-agreement]] specifies that your systems will be available 99.95% of the time, your SLO is likely 99.95% uptime and your SLI is the actual measurement of your uptime. Maybe itâ€™s 99.96%. Maybe 99.99%. To stay in compliance with your SLA, the SLI will need to meet or exceed the promises made in that document.
