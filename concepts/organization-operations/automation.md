# Automation

[[site-reliability-engineering]] teams use software as a tool to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks ([[toil]]). SRE takes the tasks that have historically been done by operations teams, often manually, and instead gives them to engineers who use software and automation to solve problems and manage production systems.

[[machine-learning]] techniques can also be used to automate some tasks.
