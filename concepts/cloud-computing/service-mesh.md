# Service Mesh

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that controls service-to-service communication over a network. It provides a method in which separate parts of an application can communicate with each other. Service meshes appear commonly in concert with cloud-based applications, [[container]] and [[microservices]].

## Examples

- [[envoy-proxy]]
- [[istio]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[container]: container "Container"
[microservices]: ../software-architecture/microservices "Microservices"
[envoy-proxy]: envoy-proxy "Envoy Proxy"
[istio]: istio "Istio"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
