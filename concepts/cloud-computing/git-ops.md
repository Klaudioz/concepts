# GitOps

At its core, GitOps is code-based infrastructure and operational procedures that rely on Git as a source control system. Itâ€™s an evolution of [[infrastructure-as-code]](IaC) and a [[devops]] best practice that leverages Git as the single source of truth, and control mechanism for creating, updating, and deleting system architecture. More simply, it is the practice of using Git pull requests to verify and automatically deploy system infrastructure modifications.
