# Canary Deployment

Canary deployments are a pattern for rolling out releases to a subset of users or servers. The idea is to first deploy the change to a small subset of servers, test it, and then roll the change out to the rest of the servers.

This process is part of your [[continuous-deployment]] pipeline, handled by tools like [[spinnaker]]
