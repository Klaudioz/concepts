# Service Discovery

Service discovery is the automatic detection of devices and services offered by these devices on a computer network. A service discovery protocol (SDP) is a network protocol that helps accomplish service discovery. Service discovery aims to reduce the configuration efforts from users.

Service discovery requires a common language to allow software agents to make use of one another's services without the need for continuous user intervention.

This important in [[microservices]] architecture and [[kubernetes]] have it's own [service discovery](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service-discovery) and managed [[dns]].
