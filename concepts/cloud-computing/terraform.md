# Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently ([[infrastructure-as-code]]). Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.
