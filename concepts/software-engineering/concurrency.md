# Concurrency (Computer Science)

In computer science, [concurrency](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)>) is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems. In more technical terms, concurrency refers to the decomposability property of a program, algorithm, or problem into order-independent or partially-ordered components or units.

> A system is said to be concurrent if it can support two or more actions in progress at the same time. A system is said to be parallel ([[parallelism]]) if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously.
