# Big-O notation

Big-O notation is the prevalent notation to represent algorithmic complexity. It gives an upper bound on complexity and hence it signifies the worst-case performance of the algorithm. With such a notation, it's easy to compare different algorithms because the notation tells clearly how the algorithm scales when input size increases. This is often called the order of growth.

Constant runtime is represented by _O_(1); linear growth is _O_(_n_); logarithmic growth is _O_(_log n_); log-linear growth is _O_(_n log n_); quadratic growth is _O_(_n_<sup>2</sup>); exponential growth is _O_(2<sup>n</sup>); factorial growth is _O_(n!).
