# Semi-supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning is an approach to machine learning that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. Semi-supervised learning falls between [[unsupervised-learning]] (with no labeled training data) and [[supervised-learning]] (with only labeled training data).
