# Linear Regression

[Linear Regression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-regression) is a machine learning algorithm based on [[supervised-learning]]. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.

Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.
