# Mean time to Restore/Recovery

MTTR or Mean Time to Recovery, is a software term that measures the time period between a service being detected as “down” to a state of being “available” from a user’s perspective. This measurement can then be used to calculate the financial impact on the company.

Mean time to recovery is calculated by adding up all the downtime in a specific period and dividing it by the number of incidents. So, let's say our systems were down for 30 minutes in two separate incidents in a 24-hour period. 30 divided by two is 15, so our MTTR is 15 minutes.
