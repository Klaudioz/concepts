# Kanban

[Kanban](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)>) (Japanese 看板, signboard or billboard) is a lean method to manage and improve work across human systems. This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks.

Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from start to finish—usually via a Kanban board. Work is **pulled as capacity permits**, rather than work being pushed into the process when requested.

In knowledge work and in software development, the aim is to provide a visual process management system which aids decision-making about what, when, and how much to produce. The underlying Kanban method originated in **lean manufacturing**, which was inspired by the Toyota Production System. Kanban is commonly used in software development in combination with other methods and frameworks such as [[scrum]].
