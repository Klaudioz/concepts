# Project based learning

#learning #education

The current school system is based on the Industrial Age model of training workers for the assembly line. The main focus is compliance and getting as much people to work the lines.

Better students will be the managers of the rest in factories. The whole system is designed for the masses. It was important at that time where middle class was relatively rare and poverty was widespread.

However in the current world, the most sought after skills are critical thinking and creativity yet our education aren’t training for that. Project based learning is one of the best way for students to learn how jobs really are in the new world.

This makes a lot of sense as more people seek not just a job but also a sense of purpose and mission . It’s no longer enough to just make a living, they want to work on things that they believe in.

It’s no wonder millennials nowadays change jobs often, trying to find a place where they can be themselves, change the world and make a good living.

The sad realisation is that a lot companies are still operating in the Industrial Age mindset. They claim to want to hire people who are creative and great at problem solving only to put them to mind numbing task and micro manage every move they make.

We need to focus on project based learning at schools and companies need to realise they too need a paradigm shift in how they define work. People are no longer working on assembly lines but instead crave for meaningful, challenging, collaborative work.
