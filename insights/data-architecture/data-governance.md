# Data Governance

Data Governance is the process, and procedure organizations use to manage, utilize, and protect their data. In this context, data can mean either all or a subset of a company’s digital and/or hard copy assets. In fact, defining what data means to an organization is one of the data governance best practices. Once you have defined data, you can brainstorm all the ways you could use your data to advance your business.

Think of data governance as the who, what, when, where, and why about your organization’s data.
