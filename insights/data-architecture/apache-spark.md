# Apache Spark

Apache Spark is a powerful unified analytics engine for large-scale distributed data processing and machine learning. On top of the Spark core data processing engine are libraries for SQL, machine learning, graph computation, and stream processing. These libraries can be used together in many stages in modern data pipelines and allow for code reuse across batch, interactive, and streaming applications. Spark is useful for [[etl]] processing, [[data-analytics]] and machine learning workloads, and for batch and interactive processing of SQL queries, machines learning inferences, and artificial intelligence applications.
